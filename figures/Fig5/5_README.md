The analysis in this directory has 3 steps.

1. Generate data for model to make predictions. These are all the notebooks which begin with `pre`.
2. Perform inference with the model. For the hidden state examination (Fig. 5a) use `other/deteRNNt/deteRNNt_inference_hiddens.py`. For the sequence analysis in Fig 5 b-e, use `other/deteRNNt/deteRNNt_inference_logits.py` with the sequence-only model. **All the necessary data files generated by inference are provided with the data by request**. This means you can skip this step, which is somewhat tedious and requires a GPU.
3. Run the analysis and plotting notebooks, which begin with `Fig`, changing the paths to point to the correct artifacts from 2 if necessary.
